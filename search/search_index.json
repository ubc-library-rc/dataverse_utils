This has nothing to do with the Microsoft product of the same name. Despite being written as they were required, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not useful or user-friendly. With these utilities you can: Upload your data sets from a tab-separated-value spreadsheet Bulk release multiple data sets Bulk delete (unpublished) assets Quickly duplicate records Replace licences and more! Get your copy today! Source code (and this documentation) is available at the Github repository https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/dataverse_utils , and the user-friendly version of the documentation is at https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/dataverse_utils . Presumably you know this already otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be reading this. Installation \u00b6 Any installation will require the use of the command line/command prompt. The easiest installation is with pip : pip install dataverse_utils There is also a server specific version if you need to use the dv_facet_date utility. This can only be run on a server hosting a Dataverse instance, so for the vast majority of users it will be unusable. This can also be installed with pip : pip install 'dataverse_utils[server]' Note the extra quotes. You can install the server version if you want to, but it\u2019s useless without server access. Upgrading \u00b6 Just as easy as installation: pip install --upgrade dataverse_utils Other methods of installing Python packages can be found at https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ . Downloading the source code \u00b6 Source code is available at https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/dataverse_utils . Working on the assumption that git is installed, you can download the whole works with: git clone https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/dataverse_utils If you have mkdocs installed, you can view the documentation in a web browser by running mkdocs from the top level directory of the downloaded source files by running mkdocs serve . The components \u00b6 Console utilities \u00b6 There are eight (8) console utilities currently available. dv_del.py : Bulk (unpublished) file deletion utility dv_ldc_uploader.py : A utility which scrapes Linguistic Data Consortium metadata from their website, converts it to Dataverse JSON and uploads it, with the possibility of including local files. As of early 2023, there is an issue which requires attaching a manually downloaded certificate chain . Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not as hard as it sounds. dv_manifest_gen.py : Creates a simple tab-separated value format file which can be edited and then used to upload files as well as file-level metadata. Normally files will be edited after creation, usually in a spreadsheet like Excel. dv_pg_facet_date.py : A server-based tool which updates the publication date facet and performs a study reindex. dv_record_copy.py : Copies an existing Dataverse study metadata record to a target collection, or replace a currently existing record. dv_release.py : A bulk release utility. Either releases all the unreleased studies in a Dataverse or individually if persistent identifiers are available. dv_replace_licences : Replaces the licence associated with a PID with text from a Markdown file. Also available as dv_replace_licenses for those using American English. dv_upload_tsv.py : Takes a tsv file in the format from dv_manifest_gen.py and does all the uploading and metadata entry. More information about these can be found on the console utilities page . Python package: dataverse_utils \u00b6 This package contains a variety of utility functions which, for the most part, allow uploads of files and associated metadata without having to touch the Dataverse GUI or to have complex JSON attached. For example, the upload_file requires no JSON attachments: dataverse_utils.upload_file('/path/to/file.ext', dv='https://targetdataverse.invalid' descr='A file description', tags=['Data', 'Example', 'Spam'], dirlabel=['path/to/spam'], mimetype='application/geo+json') Consult the API reference for full details. ldc \u00b6 The ldc component represents the Linguistic Data Consortium or LDC. The ldc module is designed to harvest LDC metadata from its catalogue, convert it to Dataverse JSON, then upload it to a Dataverse installation. Once the study has been created, the general dataverse_utils module can handle the file uploading. The ldc module requires the dryad2dataverse package. Because of this, it requires a tiny bit more effort, because LDC material doesn\u2019t have the required metadata. Here\u2019s snippet that shows how it works. import dataverse_utils.ldc as ldc ldc.ds.constants.DV_CONTACT_EMAIL='iamcontact@test.invalid' ldc.ds.constants.DV_CONTACT_NAME='Generic Support Email' KEY = 'IAM-YOUR-DVERSE-APIKEY' stud = 'LDC2021T02' #LDC study number a = ldc.Ldc(stud) a.fetch_record() #Data goes into the 'ldc' dataverse info = a.upload_metadata(url='https://dataverse.invalid', key=KEY, dv='ldc') hdl = info['data']['persistentId'] with open('/Users/you/tmp/testme.tsv') as fil: du.upload_from_tsv(fil, hdl=hdl,dv='https://dataverse.invalid', apikey=KEY) Note that one method uses key and the other apikey .

Once installed via pip, the scripts will be available via the command line and will not require calling Python explicitly. That is, they can be called from the command line directly. For example: dv_tsv_manifest is all you will need to type. Note that these programs have been primarily tested on Linux and MacOS, with Windows a tertiary priority . Windows is notable for its unusual file handling, so, as the MIT licence stipulates, there is no warranty as to the suitability for a particular purpose. In alphabetical order: dv_del \u00b6 This is bulk deletion utility for unpublished studies (or even single studies). It\u2019s useful when your automated procedures have gone wrong, or if you don\u2019t feel like navigating through many menus. Note the -i switch which can ask for manual confirmation of deletions. Usage usage: dv_del [-h] -k KEY [-d DATAVERSE | -p PID] [-i] [-u DVURL] [--version] Delete draft studies from a Dataverse collection options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -k KEY, --key KEY Dataverse user API key -d DATAVERSE, --dataverse DATAVERSE Dataverse collection short name from which to delete all draft records. eg. \"ldc\" -p PID, --persistentId PID Handle or DOI to delete in format hdl:11272.1/FK2/12345 -i, --interactive Confirm each study deletion -u DVURL, --url DVURL URL to base Dataverse installation --version Show version number and exit dv_ldc_uploader \u00b6 This is a very specialized utility which will scrape metadata from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and create a metadata record in a Dataverse. The LDC does not have an API, so the metadata is scraped from their web site. This means that the metadata may not be quite as controlled as that which comes from an API. Data from the LDC website is converted to Dryad -style JSON via dataverse_utils.ldc via the use of the dryad2dataverse library. There are two main methods of use for this utility: Multiple metadata uploads. Multiple LDC record numbers can be supplied and a study without files will be created for each one. If a TSV file with file information is upplied via the -t or --tsv switch, the utility will upload a single LDC study and upload the contents of the tsv file to the created record. Important note As of early 2023, the LDC website is not supported by certifi . You will need to manually supply a certificate chain to use the utility. To obtain the certificate chain (in Firefox) perform the following steps: Select Tools/Page Info In the Security tab, select View Certificate Scroll to \u201cPEM (chain)\u201d Right click and \u201cSave link as\u201d Use this file for the -c/\u2013certchain option below.

This utility will scrape the metadata from the LDC website (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu) and upload data based on a TSV manifest. Please note that this utility was built with the Abacus repository (https://abacus.library.ubc.ca) in mind, so many of the defaults are specific to that Dataverse installation. positional arguments: studies LDC Catalogue numbers to process, separated by spaces. eg. \"LDC2012T19 LDC2011T07\".

Default: abacus-support@lists.ubc.ca -v, --verbose Verbose output --version Show version number and exit dv_manifest_gen \u00b6 Not technically a Dataverse-specific script, this utility will generate a tab-separated value output. The file consists of 3 columns: file, description and tags , and optionally a mimetype column. Editing the result and using the upload utility to parse the tsv will add descriptive metadata, tags and file paths to an upload instead of laboriously using the Dataverse GUI. Tags may be separated by commas, eg: \u201cData, SAS, June 2021\u201d. Using stdout and a redirect will also save time. First dump a file as normal. Add other files to the end with different information using the exclude header switch -x and different tags along with output redirection >> . Usage usage: dv_manifest_gen [-h] [-f FILENAME] [-t TAG] [-x] [-r] [-q QUOTE] [-a] [-m] [--version] [files ...] Creates a file manifest in tab separated value format which can then be edited and used for file uploads to a Dataverse collection. Files can be edited to add file descriptions and comma-separated tags that will be automatically attached to metadata using products using the dataverse_utils library. Will dump to stdout unless -f or --filename is used. Using the command and a dash (ie, \"dv_manifest_gen.py -\" produces full paths for some reason. positional arguments: files Files to add to manifest. Leaving it blank will add all files in the current directory. If using -r will recursively show all. options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME Save to file instead of outputting to stdout -t TAG, --tag TAG Default tag(s). Separate with comma and use quotes if there are spaces. eg. \"Data, June 2021\". Defaults to \"Data\" -x, --no-header Don't include header in output.

Default: min -a, --show-hidden Include hidden files. -m, --mime Include autodetected mimetypes --version Show version number and exit dv_pg_facet_date \u00b6 This specialized tool is designed to be run on the server on which the Dataverse installation exists. When material is published in a Dataverse installation, the \u201cPublication Year\u201d facet in the Dataverse GUI is automatically populated with a date, which is the publication date in that Dataverse installation . This makes sense from the point of view of research data which is first deposited into a Dataverse installation, but fails as a finding aid for either; older data sets that have been migrated and reingested licensed data sets which may have been published years before they were purchased and ingested. For example, if you have a dataset that was published in 1971 but you only added it to your Dataverse installation in 2021, it is not necessarily intuitive to the end user that the \u201cpublication date\u201d in this instance would be 2021. Ideally, you might like it to be 1971. Unfortunately, there is no API-based tool to manage this date. The only way to change it, as of late 2021, is to modify the underlying PostgreSQL database directly with the desired date. Subsequently, the study must be reindexed so that the revised publication date appears as an option in the facet. This tool will perform those operations. However, the tool must be run on the server on which the Dataverse installation exists, as reindexing API calls must be from localhost and database access is necessarily restricted. There are a few other prerequisites for using this tool which differ from the rest of the scripts included in this package. The user must have shell access to the server hosting the Dataverse installation Python 3.6 or higher must be installed The user must possess a valid Dataverse API key The user must know the PostgreSQL password If the database name and user have been changed, the user must know this as well The script requires the manual installation of psycopg2-binary or have a successfully compiled psycopg2 package for Python. See https://www.psycopg.org/docs/ . This is not installed with the normal pip install of the dataverse_utils package as none of the other scripts require it and, in general, the odds of someone using this utility are low. If you forget to install it, the program will politely remind you. This cannot be stressed enough. This tool will directly change values within the PostgreSQL database which holds all of Dataverse\u2019s information . Use this at your own risk; no warranty is implied and no responsibility will be accepted for data loss, etc. If any of the options listed for the utility make no sense to you or sound like gibberish, do not use this tool. Because editing the underlying database may have a high pucker factor for some, there is both a dry-run option and an option to just dump out SQL instead of actually touching anything. These two options do not perform a study reindex and don\u2019t alter the contents of the database. Usage usage: dv_pg_facet_date [-h] [-d DBNAME] [-u USER] -p PASSWORD [-r | -o] [-s] -k KEY [-w URL] [--version] pids [pids ...] {distributionDate,productionDate,dateOfDeposit,dist,prod,dep} A utility to change the 'Production Date' web interface facet in a Dataverse installation to one of the three acceptable date types: 'distributionDate', 'productionDate', or 'dateOfDeposit'. This must be done in the PostgreSQL database directly, so this utility must be run on the *server* that hosts a Dataverse installation. Back up your database if you are unsure. positional arguments: pids persistentIdentifier {distributionDate,productionDate,dateOfDeposit,dist,prod,dep} date type which is to be shown in the facet. The short forms are aliases for the long forms. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -d DBNAME, --dbname DBNAME Database name -u USER, --user USER PostgreSQL username -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD PostgreSQL password -r, --dry-run print proposed SQL to stdout -o, --sql-only dump sql to file called *pg_sql.sql* in current directory. Appends to file if it exists -s, --save-old Dump old values to tsv called *pg_changed.tsv* in current directory. Appends to file if it exists -k KEY, --key KEY API key for Dataverse installation. -w URL, --url URL URL for base Dataverse installation. Default https://abacus.library.ubc.ca --version Show version number and exit THIS WILL EDIT YOUR POSTGRESQL DATABASE DIRECTLY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. dv_record_copy \u00b6 Copies an existing Dataverse study metadata record to a target collection, or replaces a currently existing record. Files are not copied, only the study record. This utility is useful for mateial which is in a series, requiring only minor changes for each iteration. Usage usage: dv_record_copy [-h] [-u URL] -k KEY (-c COLLECTION | -r REPLACE) [-v] pid Record duplicator for Dataverse. This utility will download a Dataverse record And then upload the study level metadata into a new record in a user-specified collection. Please note that this utility was built with the Abacus repository (https://abacus.library.ubc.ca) in mind, so many of the defaults are specific to that Dataverse installation. positional arguments: pid PID of original dataverse recordseparated by spaces. eg. \"LDC2012T19 LDC2011T07\". Case is ignored, so \"ldc2012T19\" will also work. options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -u URL, --url URL Dataverse installation base URL. Defaults to \"https://abacus.library.ubc.ca\" -k KEY, --key KEY API key -c COLLECTION, --collection COLLECTION Short name of target Dataverse collection (eg: ldc). Defaults to \"ldc\" -r REPLACE, --replace REPLACE Replace metadata data in record with this PID -v, --version Show version number and exit dv_release \u00b6 A bulk release utility for Dataverse. This utility will normally be used after a migration or large data transfer, such as a dryad2dataverse transfer from the Dryad data repository. It can release studies individually by persistent ID or just release all unreleased files in a Dataverse. Usage usage: dv_release [-h] [-u URL] -k KEY [-i] [--time STIME] [-v] [-r] [-d DV | -p PID [PID ...]] [--version] Bulk file releaser for unpublished Dataverse studies. Either releases individual studies or all unreleased studies in a single Dataverse collection. options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -u URL, --url URL Dataverse installation base URL. Default: https://abacus.library.ubc.ca -k KEY, --key KEY API key -i, --interactive Manually confirm each release --time STIME, -t STIME Time between release attempts in seconds. Default 10 -v Verbose mode -r, --dry-run Only output a list of studies to be released -d DV, --dv DV Short name of Dataverse collection to process (eg: statcan) -p PID [PID ...], --pid PID [PID ...] Handles or DOIs to release in format hdl:11272.1/FK2/12345 or doi:10.80240/FK2/NWRABI. Multiple values OK --version Show version number and exit dv_replace_licen[cs]e \u00b6 This will replace the text in a record with the text Markdown file. Text is converted to HTML. Optionally, the record can be republished without incrementing the version (ie, with type=updatecurrent . usage: dv_replace_licence [-h] [-u URL] -l LIC -k KEY [-r] [--version] studies [studies ...] Replaces the licence text in a Dataverse study and [optionally] republishes it as the same version. Superuser privileges are required for republishing as the version is not incremented. This software requires the Dataverse installation to be running Dataverse software version >= 5.6. positional arguments: studies Persistent IDs of studies options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -u URL, --url URL Base URL of Dataverse installation. Defaults to \"https://abacus.library.ubc.ca\" -l LIC, --licence LIC Licence file in Markdown format -k KEY, --key KEY Dataverse API key -r, --republish Republish study without incrementing version --version Show version number and exit dv_upload_tsv \u00b6 Now that you have a tsv full of nicely described data, you can easily upload it to an existing study if you know the persistent ID and have an API key. For the best metadata, you should probably edit it manually to add correct descriptive metadata, notably the \u201cDescription\u201d and \u201cTags\u201d. Tags are split separated by commas, so it\u2019s possible to have multiple tags for each data item, like \u201cData, SPSS, June 2021\u201d. File paths are automatically generated from the \u201cfile\u201d column. Because of this, you should probably use relative paths rather than absolute paths unless you want to have a lengthy path string in Dataverse. If uploading a tsv which includes mimetypes, be aware that mimetypes for zip files will be ignored to circumvent Dataverse\u2019s automatic unzipping feature. The rationale for manually specifiying mimetypes is to enable the use of previews which require a specific mimetype to function, but Dataverse does not correctly detect the type. For example, the GeoJSON file previewer requires a mimetype of application/geo+json , but the detection of this mimetype is not supported until Dataverse v5.9. By manually setting the mimetype, the previewer can be used by earlier Dataverse versions. Usage usage: dv_upload_tsv [-h] -p PID -k KEY [-u URL] [-r] [-t TRUNCATE] [--version] [tsv] Uploads data sets to an *existing* Dataverse study from the contents of a TSV (tab separated value) file. Metadata, file tags, paths, etc are all read from the TSV. JSON output from the Dataverse API is printed to stdout during the process. positional arguments: tsv TSV file to upload options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -p PID, --pid PID Dataverse study persistent identifier (DOI/handle) -k KEY, --key KEY API key -u URL, --url URL Dataverse installation base url. defaults to \"https://abacus.library.ubc.ca\" -r, --restrict Restrict files after upload. -t TRUNCATE, --truncate TRUNCATE Left truncate file path. As Dataverse studies can retain directory structure, you can set an arbitrary starting point by removing the leftmost portion. Eg: if the TSV has a file path of /home/user/Data/file.txt, setting --truncate to \"/home/user\" would have file.txt in the Data directory in the Dataverse study. The file is still loaded from the path in the spreadsheet. Defaults to no truncation. --version Show version number and exit Notes for Windows users \u00b6 Command line scripts for Python may not necessarily behave the way they do in Linux/Mac, depending on how you access them.

The only way to change it, as of late 2021, is to modify the underlying PostgreSQL database directly with the desired date. Subsequently, the study must be reindexed so that the revised publication date appears as an option in the facet. This tool will perform those operations. However, the tool must be run on the server on which the Dataverse installation exists, as reindexing API calls must be from localhost and database access is necessarily restricted. There are a few other prerequisites for using this tool which differ from the rest of the scripts included in this package. The user must have shell access to the server hosting the Dataverse installation Python 3.6 or higher must be installed The user must possess a valid Dataverse API key The user must know the PostgreSQL password If the database name and user have been changed, the user must know this as well The script requires the manual installation of psycopg2-binary or have a successfully compiled psycopg2 package for Python. See https://www.psycopg.org/docs/ . This is not installed with the normal pip install of the dataverse_utils package as none of the other scripts require it and, in general, the odds of someone using this utility are low. If you forget to install it, the program will politely remind you. This cannot be stressed enough. This tool will directly change values within the PostgreSQL database which holds all of Dataverse\u2019s information . Use this at your own risk; no warranty is implied and no responsibility will be accepted for data loss, etc. If any of the options listed for the utility make no sense to you or sound like gibberish, do not use this tool. Because editing the underlying database may have a high pucker factor for some, there is both a dry-run option and an option to just dump out SQL instead of actually touching anything. These two options do not perform a study reindex and don\u2019t alter the contents of the database.

For the best metadata, you should probably edit it manually to add correct descriptive metadata, notably the \u201cDescription\u201d and \u201cTags\u201d. Tags are split separated by commas, so it\u2019s possible to have multiple tags for each data item, like \u201cData, SPSS, June 2021\u201d. File paths are automatically generated from the \u201cfile\u201d column. Because of this, you should probably use relative paths rather than absolute paths unless you want to have a lengthy path string in Dataverse. If uploading a tsv which includes mimetypes, be aware that mimetypes for zip files will be ignored to circumvent Dataverse\u2019s automatic unzipping feature. The rationale for manually specifiying mimetypes is to enable the use of previews which require a specific mimetype to function, but Dataverse does not correctly detect the type. For example, the GeoJSON file previewer requires a mimetype of application/geo+json , but the detection of this mimetype is not supported until Dataverse v5.9. By manually setting the mimetype, the previewer can be used by earlier Dataverse versions.
