# Dataverse utilities

This is a generalized set of utilities which help with managing [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) repositories. These utilities are ad-hoc, written as needed and subject to change, so this is not something you should be using in distributed applications, but more for one-off and quick projects.

For more details, please see the `docs` directory, beginning with [index.md](docs/index.md)
