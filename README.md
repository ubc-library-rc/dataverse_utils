# Dataverse utilities

This is a Python library and generalized set of utilities which help with managing [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) repositories. These utilities are ad-hoc, written as needed and may be subject to change. Luckily they use git, so if they stop working for you it's possible to roll back to a version that does.

Technology is magic.

The defaults are mostly to work the University of British Columbia Library's installation of Dataverse, <https://abacus.library.ubc.ca>, but can of course be changed.

For more details, please see the `docs` directory, beginning with [index.md](docs/index.md)

The primary repository for this software is at <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/dataverse_utils>, and user-friendly documentation is available at <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/dataverse_utils>.
